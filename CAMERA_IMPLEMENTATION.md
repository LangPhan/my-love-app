# Camera Capture Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Camera Capture Page (`/memories/new`)
- **Full-screen camera interface** with live video feed
- **Direct camera access** using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`
- **Rear camera by default** (environment facing mode)
- **High-quality capture** (1920x1080 ideal resolution)

### 2. Photo Preview
- **Full-screen image preview** after capture
- **Title input overlay** positioned at bottom center
- **Transparent backdrop** with gradient overlay for better readability
- **Image displayed with object-contain** to preserve aspect ratio

### 3. User Actions
- ✅ **Capture**: Large circular button to take photo
- ✅ **Retake**: Discard and return to camera
- ✅ **Save**: Upload photo with title to memories
- ✅ **Cancel**: Exit without saving
- ✅ **Gallery**: Fallback option if camera permission denied

### 4. Upload Integration
- Uses existing `useUploadMemory` hook from React Query
- Uploads to Appwrite Storage (MEMORIES bucket)
- Creates database entry in MEMORIES collection
- Converts canvas to JPEG blob (90% quality)
- Proper File object creation with timestamp

### 5. User Experience
- **Loading states** during upload with spinner
- **Error handling** for camera permission issues
- **Automatic redirect** to `/memories` on success
- **Authentication checks** before allowing access
- **Couple validation** ensures user is connected

### 6. Mobile-First Design
- **Touch-optimized buttons** (80px capture button)
- **Gradient overlays** for better UI visibility
- **Full-screen experience** without header/navigation
- **Gallery fallback** for devices without camera access

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `src/app/(main)/memories/new/page.tsx` - Main camera capture component
2. `src/app/(main)/memories/new/layout.tsx` - Minimal layout for full-screen
3. `CAMERA_FEATURE.md` - Feature documentation

### Modified Files:
- None (QuickActions.tsx already had correct route)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Camera API Implementation
```typescript
const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: {
    facingMode: "environment", // Rear camera
    width: { ideal: 1920 },
    height: { ideal: 1080 },
  },
});
```

### Image Capture Process
1. Video stream displayed in `<video>` element
2. On capture, draw video frame to `<canvas>`
3. Convert canvas to blob (JPEG, 90% quality)
4. Create File object for upload
5. Use existing upload mutation

### Upload Flow
```typescript
uploadMemoryMutation.mutateAsync({
  file,
  coupleId,
  uploadedBy: user.$id,
  uploaderName: user.name,
  metadata: {
    title: title || "Untitled Memory",
    description: "",
    tags: [],
    isPrivate: false,
  },
});
```

## 🎨 UI Components Used

- `Button` - Capture, retake, save, cancel actions
- `Card` - Error/authentication states
- `Input` - Title entry on preview
- Icons: `Camera`, `Check`, `X`, `RotateCcw`, `Loader2`

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to homepage**: `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Click "Add Memory"** quick action button
4. **Allow camera permissions** when prompted
5. **Tap capture button** to take photo
6. **Add title** (optional) in bottom input field
7. **Tap "Save Memory"** to upload
8. **Verify redirect** to `/memories` page

## 📱 Browser/Device Requirements

- ✅ HTTPS required in production (camera API restriction)
- ✅ Modern browser with getUserMedia support
- ✅ Camera permission granted by user
- ✅ Fallback to file input if camera unavailable

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

- Camera permission requested on page load
- User can deny and use gallery instead
- Files stored in Appwrite with proper permissions
- Only authenticated users with couple can access

## 🎯 User Journey

```
Homepage → "Add Memory" button → Camera page
↓
Grant permission → Live camera feed
↓
Tap capture → Preview with title input
↓
"Save Memory" → Upload to Appwrite → Redirect to /memories
```
